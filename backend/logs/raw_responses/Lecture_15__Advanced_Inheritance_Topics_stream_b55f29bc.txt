Now, what if you try to store objects of derived classes, like 'Text' or 'Comic', in this 'Book' array? As shown in the conceptual code, if you assign a 'Comic' object to an element of a 'Book' array, a problem arises. The 'Comic' object has specific data members, like 'hero', that are not part of the 'Book' class. When this assignment happens, the object is 'sliced' â€“ only the 'Book' part of the 'Comic' object is stored, and all derived-specific information is lost. This is known as object slicing.",

If we create an array of 'Comic' objects, 'comicsArray', and pass it to this function, slicing occurs. Inside 'processBooks', each element of the 'books' array is treated strictly as a 'Book'. Any fields specific to 'Comic', like a 'hero' field, are lost because the memory allocated for each element in the 'books' array corresponds to the size of a 'Book' object, not a 'Comic' object.

            "transcript": "Why does slicing happen? The fundamental reason is that array elements are stored contiguously in memory, one after the other. For the compiler to access an element like 'books[i]', it needs to calculate its memory address. This calculation relies on all elements having the same, uniform size. If you have an array of 'Book' objects, each slot in that array is sized to hold exactly one 'Book'. If a 'Comic' object, which might be larger due to additional members, is forced into that slot, it gets 'sliced' down to the size of a 'Book'. The extra parts of the 'Comic' object are simply cut off because there's no space allocated for them.",

            "slide_markdown": "### Solution: Use Arrays of Pointers (or Smart Pointers)\n\nTo achieve polymorphism with collections, use arrays of pointers or smart pointers to the base class:\n\n```cpp\nBook* bookPtrs[2];\nbookPtrs[0] = new Book{\"Generic\", \"Title\", 100};\nbookPtrs[1] = new Comic{\"Superhero\", \"Adventures\", 50, \"HeroMan\"};\n\n// No slicing: bookPtrs[1] points to a complete Comic object.\n// Virtual methods will work correctly.\n\n// Better: Use std::vector and smart pointers\nstd::vector<std::unique_ptr<Book>> bookCollection;\nbookCollection.push_back(std::make_unique<Book>(...));\nbookCollection.push_back(std::make_unique<Comic>(...));\n```\n\n**Rule**: Never use arrays of objects polymorphically.",
            "transcript": "The correct way to handle collections of polymorphic objects is to use arrays of pointers, or even better, smart pointers, to the base class. For instance, you can have an array of 'Book*' (pointers to Book). Each pointer in this array can then point to an actual 'Book' object or an object of any class derived from 'Book', like 'Comic' or 'Text'. Because you are storing pointers, and all pointers have the same size, there's no issue with uniform element size in the array itself. The objects they point to reside elsewhere in memory and retain their full, unsliced form. This allows virtual functions to work as expected, dispatching to the correct derived class methods. Using 'std::vector' with smart pointers like 'std::unique_ptr' or 'std::shared_ptr' is the modern C++ best practice for managing such collections, as it also handles memory management automatically.",

            "transcript": "To summarize our discussion on polymorphic arrays and slicing: attempting to store derived class objects directly within an array typed to a base class will result in object slicing. This loss of derived-specific information happens because arrays require all their elements to be of the same size, forcing derived objects to be truncated to fit the base class's size. The key takeaway is a firm rule: never use arrays of objects polymorphically. Instead, you should always use arrays or, preferably, standard library vectors of base class pointers or smart pointers. These pointers can then point to dynamically allocated objects of various derived types, preserving their full integrity and enabling true polymorphic behavior.",

When you don't explicitly define copy or move constructors and assignment operators in your derived class, the compiler will often generate them for you.

After the base class part is copied or moved, the compiler will then perform a member-wise copy or move for each of the fields that are unique to the derived class. For example, if 'Text' derives from 'Book' and has a 'topic_' string, copying a 'Text' object will involve copying its 'Book' part using 'Book's copy constructor, and then copying the 'topic_' string using the string's copy constructor.",

You pass the 'other' derived object to the base class constructor, which correctly slices it and copies the base portion. After that, in the member initialization list or the body of the constructor, you handle the copying of the members specific to the derived class.

For a custom move constructor, you'll call the base class's move constructor in the member initialization list, typically using 'std::move' on the 'other' derived object to pass its base part as an rvalue. Then, you'll move-initialize the derived class's own members, again using 'std::move' on 'other's members. For a custom move assignment operator, you'll first call the base class's move assignment operator, passing 'std::move(other)', and then move-assign the derived class's members. 'std::move' is essential here; it doesn't actually move anything but casts its argument to an rvalue reference, which allows the compiler to select the move overload of constructors or assignment operators if available.

What it does is unconditionally cast its argument 'x' to an rvalue reference type. This cast is a signal to the compiler that the object 'x' can be 'moved from', meaning its resources can potentially be taken over by another object. This is crucial when you want to invoke a move constructor or a move assignment operator with an object that is an lvalue, like the parameter 'other' in a move operation, or a named local variable. Without 'std::move', the compiler would select the copy operation because lvalues bind to lvalue references (for copy) and not directly to rvalue references (for move). After an object has been moved from using 'std::move', it remains in a valid but unspecified state. You should not make assumptions about its value, though you can safely assign a new value to it or let it be destroyed.",

When you implement custom copy or move constructors, you must explicitly call the base class's constructor in the member initialization list. For custom copy or move assignment operators, you explicitly call the base class's assignment operator within the body of your derived class's operator. 'std::move' is the tool to cast lvalues to rvalue references, thereby enabling move operations where they might otherwise default to copy.

Similarly, assigning a 'Comic' to a 'Text' object could lead to slicing if it goes through a 'Book' assignment path. However, our primary focus for partial assignment in this subtopic is the scenario where assignment happens between two objects of the same derived type, but through base class pointers, like '*pb1 = *pb2;'. To address this specific problem and ensure the full derived object is assigned, making 'operator=' virtual in the base class is a common approach. This allows for dynamic dispatch to the most derived version of the assignment operator.",

            "transcript": "To summarize partial assignment: when you assign one derived object to another using base class pointers, for example '*pb1 = *pb2;', and the assignment operator in the base class is non-virtual, you will encounter partial assignment. This means only the base class portion of the target object gets updated, while its derived-specific members are left unchanged. This happens because the call resolves to the base class's assignment operator at compile time. One potential solution to ensure the entire object is assigned correctly according to its actual derived type is to declare the assignment operator as virtual in the base class. This would allow dynamic dispatch to call the appropriate assignment operator in the derived class, assuming it's implemented to correctly handle the assignment from another object of its type or a compatible type.",

You make a class abstract by including at least one pure virtual function in its definition. For our example hierarchy, 'Book' could be an abstract class, with 'Normal Book', 'Text', and 'Comic' as concrete derived classes that can be instantiated.",

Then, in a corresponding source file, or even inline outside the class definition, you must provide a body for this pure virtual destructor. This body is often empty, but it could contain cleanup code that is common to all classes in the hierarchy if needed.

The Destructor Chain Explained\n\nWhen a derived class object is destroyed (e.g., `delete derivedPtr;` where `derivedPtr` points to a `Text` object):\n\n1.  The **derived class destructor** runs (`~Text()`).\n2.  Then, member objects of the derived class are destroyed.\n3.  Crucially, the **base class destructor** is **automatically called** (`~AbstractBook()`).\n4.  Then, member objects of the base class are destroyed.\n\nIf the base class destructor (even pure virtual) has no implementation, this chain breaks, leading to a **linker error**.",
            "transcript": "The reason a pure virtual destructor needs an implementation lies in the C++ object destruction chain. When an object of a derived class is destroyed, for instance, when you 'delete' a pointer to a 'Text' object, a sequence of destructors is called. First, the destructor of the most derived class, 'Text' in this case, is executed. After its body completes, any member objects within 'Text' are destroyed. Then, and this is the critical part, the destructor of its immediate base class, 'AbstractBook', is automatically invoked. This process continues up the inheritance hierarchy. If 'AbstractBook's destructor, even though pure virtual, didn't have an implementation for the linker to find, this chain would be broken, and you would get a linker error. The compiler and linker need that function body to call.",

A destructor can be made pure virtual, which contributes to making the class abstract. However, a pure virtual destructor is unique in that it must still be given an implementation. This requirement stems from the C++ object destruction process, where the destructor of a base class is automatically called after the derived class's destructor completes. If this implementation is missing, the program will fail to link. So, always provide a body for your pure virtual destructors, even if it's just an empty pair of braces.",

We learned that polymorphic arrays of objects are problematic due to slicing and should be replaced with arrays or vectors of pointers. We saw how to correctly implement copy and move semantics in derived classes by explicitly handling the base class subobject. We also discussed the issue of partial assignment when assigning through base class pointers with non-virtual assignment operators. Finally, we reinforced the importance of using abstract superclasses for polymorphism and the specific requirement to implement pure virtual destructors due to the C++ destruction chain. Mastering these concepts will significantly enhance your ability to write effective and reliable object-oriented C++ programs.",
