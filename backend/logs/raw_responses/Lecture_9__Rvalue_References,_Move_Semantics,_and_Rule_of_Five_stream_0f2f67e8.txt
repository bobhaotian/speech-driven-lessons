An lvalue, short for locator value, refers to an object that has an identifiable memory location – essentially, something you can take the address of. Because they have a persistent location, lvalues can typically appear on the left-hand side of an assignment statement. Common examples include variables, elements within an array, or data members of an object. An lvalue reference, denoted by a single ampersand, acts as an alias for an already existing lvalue. It must be initialized when declared and, once initialized, it always refers to that same object; it cannot be made to refer to a different object later. Lvalue references are commonly used in function parameters to pass arguments by reference, which can avoid costly copies for large objects or allow the function to modify the original argument.",

            "transcript": "Now, let's consider a common scenario: a function that returns an object by value. In the example shown, the `createNode` function creates a local `Node` object and returns it. When `my_node` is initialized with the result of `createNode()`, a sequence of operations occurs. First, `temp_node` inside the function is typically copied into a temporary object in the caller's scope. Then, this temporary object is used to initialize `my_node`, usually invoking the `Node`'s copy constructor. This temporary object, which exists only for the duration of this statement, is an example of an rvalue. If the `Node` class manages resources that require deep copying, like dynamically allocated memory, these copy operations can be very inefficient. This is particularly wasteful because the temporary object is going to be destroyed immediately after `my_node` is initialized. We're doing a full copy of its resources, only to discard the original source of those resources moments later.",

An rvalue is an expression that typically refers to a temporary object – something that doesn't have a persistent, identifiable memory location in the same way an lvalue does. Rvalues are usually destroyed at the end of the expression in which they are created. Examples include literal values like 42 or string literals, the value returned by a function that returns by value, or objects resulting from explicit type conversions. You generally can't assign to an rvalue. An rvalue reference, denoted by a double ampersand `&&`, is a type of reference that can bind to an rvalue. This is powerful because it gives us a way to get a 'handle' on a temporary object. Once we have this handle, we can design special functions (like move constructors and move assignment operators) that can 'steal' the resources from the temporary object, which is often much more efficient than performing a full copy, especially since the temporary is about to be discarded anyway.",

This function creates one of two `Node` objects (`odds` or `evens`) and returns one of them by value based on user input. The crucial part is `return (c == '0') ? evens : odds;`. This return statement creates a temporary copy of either `evens` or `odds`. If we initialize a `Node` like `n1` using `Node n1 = oddsOrEvens();`, the copy constructor of `Node` will be invoked with this temporary object as its source. If `Node` involves deep copying, this is where the waste occurs. However, if we use an rvalue reference, as in `Node &&r_ref_n = oddsOrEvens();`, `r_ref_n` binds directly to the temporary object returned by the function. An important feature here is that binding a temporary to an rvalue reference extends the lifetime of that temporary object to match the lifetime of the reference itself. This gives us a chance to interact with the temporary, specifically to move from it, which we'll see next.",

            "transcript": "Sometimes, we have an lvalue (a named object) that we know we're finished with, and we'd like to efficiently transfer its resources to another object. We can't directly use a move constructor or move assignment operator with an lvalue because they expect rvalue references. This is where `std::move`, found in the `<utility>` header, comes in. `std::move` is a utility function that performs an unconditional cast of its argument to an rvalue reference. For example, if `n1` is an lvalue, `std::move(n1)` produces an rvalue reference to `n1`. If this result is then used to initialize another object `n2`, it allows `n2`'s move constructor to be selected by overload resolution, if one exists. It's crucial to understand that `std::move` itself doesn't perform any moving of data. It's purely a cast. The actual 'moving' happens inside the move constructor or move assignment operator that gets called as a result of this cast. After an object has been 'moved from' using `std::move`, it is left in a valid but unspecified state. This means you shouldn't rely on its previous value and should generally avoid using it unless you re-initialize it.",

A key problem we identified is that copying data from these temporary objects can be inefficient, especially for complex objects that manage resources. C++11 introduced rvalue references, denoted by `&&`, which can bind to these rvalues. A significant aspect is that binding an rvalue reference to a temporary extends that temporary's lifetime, allowing us to interact with it. This capability is the foundation for move semantics, a powerful C++ feature that allows us to 'steal' or transfer resources from temporary objects rather than performing expensive copies. We also saw `std::move`, a utility that casts an lvalue to an rvalue reference, effectively signaling that we are done with the lvalue's resources and they can be taken over by another object.",

            "transcript": "Now that we understand rvalue references, let's look at the move constructor. A move constructor is a special constructor designed to initialize a new object by efficiently transferring resources from a temporary object, which is an rvalue. It achieves this by 'stealing' the resources from the source object rather than performing a deep copy. The typical signature for a move constructor is `ClassName(ClassName &&other)`. Here, `other` is an rvalue reference to an object of the same class, which is the source from which resources will be moved. You'll often see move constructors marked with `noexcept`. This is a strong recommendation because specifying that a move constructor (and move assignment operator) won't throw exceptions allows standard library containers and algorithms to use them more aggressively for optimization. If a move operation could throw, the standard library might have to fall back to slower copy operations to maintain strong exception safety guarantees.",

            "transcript": "The core idea behind a move constructor is the 'stealing' mechanism. Unlike a copy constructor that would duplicate all resources, a move constructor efficiently transfers ownership. First, it copies any data that is cheap to copy, such as simple plain old data types (PODs), pointers, or resource handles. Then, for dynamically allocated resources or other owned resources, it takes ownership by essentially copying the pointer or handle from the source object (`other`) to the new object being constructed. Finally, and this is a critical step, it modifies the source object (`other`) to release its ownership of the now-moved resources. Typically, this means setting its pointers to `nullptr` or putting it into a well-defined empty state. This ensures that when `other` is eventually destructed (which will happen soon, as it's usually a temporary), its destructor doesn't try to deallocate the resources that have been transferred to the new object, which would lead to double-free errors or other corruption. In the `Node` example, we copy `other.data` and the `other.next` pointer. Then, we set `other.next` to `nullptr` so that `other` no longer points to the rest of the list that has just been moved.",

A `Node` typically has some data and a pointer `next` to the subsequent node. We'll assume it has a destructor that would `delete next` to clean up the rest of the list. For comparison, a copy constructor would perform a deep copy: it copies `data`, and if `other.next` is not null, it recursively creates a new `Node` by copying `*other.next`. This can be expensive for long lists. Now, contrast this with the move constructor: `Node(Node &&other) noexcept`. It initializes its `data` with `other.data` and its `next` pointer with `other.next`. This is a shallow copy of the members. The crucial step is `other.next = nullptr;`. This effectively 'steals' the `next` pointer (and thus the rest ofthe list it points to) from `other`. `other` is now left in a state where its `next` pointer is null, so its destructor won't delete the list segment that has been moved.",

It should also be possible to assign a new value to a moved-from object. However, while the state is valid, its specific value is generally unspecified, unless the class documentation explicitly states otherwise. This means you shouldn't make any assumptions about the data it holds after a move. For our `Node` example, after moving from `other`, `other.data` might still hold its original value, but `other.next` will be `nullptr`.

If you're initializing a new object and the source of that initialization is an rvalue of the same class type, and a move constructor is available, it will generally be preferred over the copy constructor. One common scenario is when you initialize an object from what's called a prvalue, or pure rvalue, such as the temporary object returned by a function like our `oddsOrEvens()`. If `Node` has a move constructor, it will be used to initialize `n`. Another key scenario is when you explicitly use `std::move` to cast an lvalue to an rvalue reference. In `Node n2 = std::move(n1);`, `std::move(n1)` creates an rvalue expression, leading to the invocation of `n2`'s move constructor.

First, although self-assignment with an rvalue is very unlikely (as `other` is typically a distinct temporary object), robust assignment operators often include a self-assignment check (`if (this == &other)`). More importantly, before taking ownership of `other`'s resources, the current object (`*this`) must release any resources it currently owns to prevent resource leaks. Then, it transfers the resources from `other` in a way similar to the move constructor – by copying pointers or handles. After the transfer, `other` must be left in a valid but unspecified state, with its own pointers nullified to signify it no longer owns the resources. Finally, the operator returns `*this`.

The OCR from page 38 shows a concise version using `std::swap`: `using std::swap; swap(data, other.data); swap(next, other.next); return *this;`. How does this work? When we swap `this->next` with `other.next`, `this` object now points to the resources previously owned by `other`. `other`, in turn, now points to the resources originally owned by `this`. Since `other` is an rvalue reference (typically bound to a temporary object that's about to be destroyed), when `other` is destroyed, its destructor will clean up the resources that `this` originally held. This is a clever way to manage resource deallocation and acquisition. The `this` object effectively gets the new resources, and the old resources are passed to the temporary `other` to be cleaned up upon its destruction. A self-assignment check (`if (this == &other)`) isn't strictly necessary here because `other` being an rvalue reference usually implies it's a different object, often a temporary. If we didn't use the swap idiom, we'd have to manually `delete next;`, then copy `other.data` and `other.next`, and finally set `other.next = nullptr;`.",

            "transcript": "The move assignment operator, much like the move constructor, is chosen by the compiler through overload resolution. It's called when you assign an rvalue to an already existing object. For instance, if you have an existing `Node` object `n`, and you assign to it the result of a function that returns a `Node` by value (like `n = oddsOrEvens();`), the temporary object returned by `oddsOrEvens()` is an rvalue. If `Node` has a move assignment operator, it will be preferred over the copy assignment operator for this operation. Similarly, if you have two existing `Node` objects, `n1` and `n2`, and you write `n1 = std::move(n2);`, `std::move(n2)` converts `n2` into an rvalue expression. This makes the compiler choose `n1`'s move assignment operator. After this, `n2` will be in that characteristic valid but unspecified state. A key rule is that if both move and copy versions of constructors or assignment operators exist, the move versions are preferred when the source expression is an rvalue. If move versions are not available, the compiler might fall back to using the copy versions, for example, by binding the rvalue to a const lvalue reference parameter of a copy operation.",

The notes on pages 38 and 39 highlight an important point: with modern compilers like g++, in a case like `Vec c = makeAvec();`, it's possible that only the basic constructor of `Vec` (the one called inside `makeAvec` to create `{0,0}`) runs, and no copy or move constructor is invoked at all for `c`. Since C++17, for certain scenarios involving initialization from prvalues (pure rvalues), elision is actually mandatory. You don't need to memorize all the exact rules for when elision occurs, but it's important to be aware that it's a common optimization.

There's no intermediate temporary object created in the caller's scope, and thus no subsequent copy or move from that temporary to `c`. The effect is as if `makeAvec`'s return operation directly initialized `c`. Similarly, consider passing the result of `makeAvec` to a function `doSomething` that takes a `Vec` by value: `doSomething(makeAvec());`.

This guideline evolved from the older 'Rule of Three,' which included the destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator. The addition of move semantics in C++11 expanded this to the Rule of Five. The underlying reason is usually resource management. If your class directly manages a resource – like dynamically allocated memory, file handles, network sockets, or synchronization primitives like mutexes – the compiler-generated default behaviors for copying, moving, and destruction are often inadequate. For example, a default copy of an object holding a raw pointer to dynamic memory would result in a shallow copy of that pointer.

If the destructor is doing special work, it's highly probable that the default copy constructor and copy assignment operator (which perform member-wise shallow copies) will be incorrect. For instance, they might just copy a pointer, leading to two objects sharing ownership of a resource that should be uniquely owned, or leading to shallow copies where deep copies are needed.

If your class is composed of members that are themselves well-behaved resource-managing types, or are simple data types, then the compiler-generated destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment, move constructor, and move assignment operators will often do the right thing by simply invoking the corresponding operations on each member.

            "transcript": "Let's briefly discuss how operators are implemented in C++, specifically focusing on whether they are member functions or non-member functions. The assignment operator, `operator=`, has a special restriction: it must be implemented as a non-static member function of a class. You cannot define it as a standalone non-member function, even if it's a friend. When an operator is declared as a member function, the object on which the operator is invoked becomes the implicit left-hand operand, accessible via the `this` pointer within the operator's implementation. For example, when you write `n1 = n2;`, and `operator=` is a member of `Node`'s class, this expression is essentially translated by the compiler into `n1.operator=(n2);`. Inside the body of `operator=`, the `this` pointer will refer to `n1`.",

If implemented as a non-member function, both (or all, for unary/ternary) operands are typically passed as explicit arguments. Non-member operator overloads are often declared as `friend` functions if they need to access the private or protected members of the class they operate on. For example, on page 40, `Vec`'s `operator+` is shown as a member function. When you write `v1 + v2`, it's equivalent to `v1.operator+(v2)`, where `v1` is `*this` and `v2` is the `other` parameter.",

When `operator+` is a member, `v1 + v2` is `v1.operator+(v2)`. This means the left operand `v1` must be an object of the class. If it's a non-member function `operator+(v1, v2)`, the compiler looks for a function that can take both `v1` and `v2` as arguments. This can be more flexible if implicit conversions are desired for either operand, especially the left-hand one, although standard argument deduction rules apply. A very common case where non-member operators are essential is with I/O stream operators `<<` and `>>`. For `std::cout << myObject;`, the left-hand operand is `std::cout` (an `std::ostream` object), not `myObject`. Thus, `operator<<` for `myObject` must be a non-member function, typically a friend, taking the stream as its first parameter and `myObject` as its second.",

If this is implemented as a member function `Vec Vec::operator*(int k) const`, it handles expressions like `v1 * 2` naturally, as `v1.operator*(2)`. However, this member function approach doesn't directly support the commutative case `2 * v1`, because the integer `2` is not an object of type `Vec` and therefore cannot invoke a member function. To enable `2 * v1`, you would typically need to provide a separate non-member (often friend) function: `Vec operator*(int k, const Vec& v)`.

For most other operators, you have a choice: they can be implemented as member functions or as non-member functions, which are often declared as friends if they need access to the class's private or protected members. If an operator is a member, the `this` pointer refers to its left-hand operand. Non-member operators can provide better symmetry in how operands are treated, which is particularly useful when dealing with type conversions or when the natural left-hand operand isn't an object of your class, as seen with I/O streams or scalar multiplication like `int * MyClass`. The decision often hinges on factors like the desired symmetry of operations, the need to access private members, and the types of the operands involved.",

            "transcript": "Let's summarize the key takeaways from Lecture 9. We started with rvalue references (`&&`), which are essential for interacting with temporary objects and form the basis of move semantics. This led us to move constructors and move assignment operators. These special member functions allow us to efficiently 'steal' resources from rvalue (temporary) sources instead of performing expensive deep copies. It's important to remember that they leave the source object in a valid but generally unspecified state and should ideally be marked `noexcept` to allow for better optimization by standard library components. We then discussed copy and move elision, such as RVO and NRVO, where the compiler can optimize away copy or move operations entirely, even if those operations have side effects. This led to the Rule of Five: if your class needs to define any of the five special member functions—destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, or move assignment operator—it's a strong indication you probably need to define all of them, typically because your class is managing a raw resource. However, the 'Rule of Zero' encourages using existing RAII resource-managing classes to often avoid needing to write any of these five yourself. Finally, we touched on operator overloading, noting that `operator=` must be a member, while other operators can be members or non-members, with non-members often chosen for symmetry.",
