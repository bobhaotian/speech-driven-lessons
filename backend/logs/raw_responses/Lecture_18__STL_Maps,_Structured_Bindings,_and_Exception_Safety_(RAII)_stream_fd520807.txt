Think of it like a dictionary in Python or an associative array in other languages. A key characteristic of `std::map` is that keys are unique, and the elements are always stored sorted by their keys. In this example, we're creating a map named `scores` where keys are strings (like student names) and values are integers (like their scores).",

For a `std::string`, it's an empty string. In the example, `m[\"def\"] = 2` inserts the key \"def\" with value 2.

For example, `for (const auto& [key, value] : m)` declares `key` and `value`. The `auto` keyword is used, and the compiler deduces the types for `key` and `value` from the elements of the map. `key` would be `const std::string` and `value` would be `int` in this example (if `m` is `std::map<std::string, int>`).

Similarly, for C-style arrays with compile-time known bounds, you can unpack their elements. If `arr` is an array of 3 integers, `auto [a, b, c] = arr;` will assign `arr[0]` to `a`, `arr[1]` to `b`, and `arr[2]` to `c`.

But the actual `C` object that `p` was pointing to, the one created by `new C`, remains on the heap. Since `delete p;` was skipped, this heap-allocated object is now leaked.

However, this approach has its own problems. If `g()` doesn't throw, you still need to `delete p` after the `try-catch` block, leading to `delete p;` appearing in two places. This duplication is a sign of a fragile design. What if `g()` throws, you `delete p` in the `catch`, and then you re-throw the exception? If the original code also had a `delete p` after the call to `g()`, it might try to delete already freed memory if not structured carefully. Also, what if the `new C` operation itself failed and threw `std::bad_alloc`? Then `p` would be uninitialized, and trying to `delete p` would be dangerous.

Some programming languages provide a `finally` block, which is guaranteed to execute after a `try` block, no matter what. C++ does not have such a `finally` construct. Instead, C++ provides a different, powerful guarantee: when a scope is exited, whether normally or due to an exception causing stack unwinding, the destructors of all objects allocated on the stack within that scope are automatically invoked.

            "transcript": "To recap this introduction to exception safety: the main problem is that exceptions can cause our programs to bypass crucial cleanup code, especially for resources managed on the heap, like memory allocated with `new`. While C++'s stack unwinding mechanism ensures that destructors of local, stack-allocated objects are called, it doesn't automatically handle heap memory. This can lead to resource leaks. The critical C++ guarantee we leverage is that destructors of local objects *will* run. This guarantee is what makes the Resource Allocation Is Initialization, or RAII, idiom possible and effective.",

It's a powerful and widely used C++ technique for managing resources like memory, file handles, network connections, mutexes, and more. The core idea is to bind the lifetime of a resource to the lifetime of an object that is allocated on the stack. You acquire the resource when the stack object is initialized, typically in its constructor. And you release the resource when the stack object is destroyed, which happens in its destructor. Because C++ guarantees that destructors of stack-allocated objects are called when they go out of scope—whether that scope is exited normally or due to an exception—the resource managed by the object is guaranteed to be released correctly.",

We had `C *p = new C;`, then a call to `g()`, and then `delete p;`. The issue was that `delete p` could be skipped if `g()` threw an exception. The RAII solution is to wrap the raw pointer `p` inside a dedicated manager object that is allocated on the stack. This wrapper object's constructor would take ownership of the raw pointer (resource acquisition), and its destructor would be responsible for calling `delete` on that pointer (resource release). If we create such a wrapper on the stack, then when it goes out of scope for any reason, its destructor will execute, ensuring the `delete` operation happens.

It's designed to hold a pointer to a dynamically allocated object and ensure that this object is properly deleted when the `unique_ptr` itself is destroyed (i.e., goes out of scope). You can create a `unique_ptr` by passing it a raw pointer obtained from `new`, or, more preferably, by using the `std::make_unique` helper function, which is safer in complex expressions involving exceptions. Once the `unique_ptr` owns the object, you can use it much like a raw pointer, for example, with the `->` operator to access members. The magic happens when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope: its destructor automatically calls `delete` on the raw pointer it holds, freeing the allocated memory.",

The `std::move()` utility function can be used to explicitly cast a `unique_ptr` to an rvalue reference, signaling that its resource can be 'moved' or 'stolen'. When you move from `p1` to `p2`, `p2` takes ownership of the object originally managed by `p1`, and `p1` is then set to a null state, effectively relinquishing its ownership. After the move, `p1` no longer points to the object. Functions can also return a `std::unique_ptr` by value.

This isn't the full standard library version, but it illustrates the core concepts. It's a template class holding a raw pointer. The constructor is `explicit` to prevent accidental implicit conversions from raw pointers. The destructor calls `delete` on the stored pointer. Crucially, the copy constructor and copy assignment operator are explicitly deleted, enforcing unique ownership. The move constructor takes an rvalue reference (`&&other`), 'steals' the pointer from `other`, and nulls out `other.ptr`. The move assignment operator shown uses `std::swap` to exchange pointers with `other`, effectively transferring ownership. The `operator*` and `operator->` are provided for dereferencing and member access, similar to raw pointers. A `get()` method allows access to the underlying raw pointer if needed, but without transferring ownership.

Any other parts of your code that need to access the resource but don't own it can use raw pointers. You can get a raw pointer from a `unique_ptr` using its `get()` method.
