            "transcript": "So, what's the correct way to handle collections of polymorphic objects? The key recommendation is to never use arrays of objects polymorphically due to the slicing problem. Instead, you should use arrays of pointers, or even better, arrays of smart pointers, to base class objects. For example, 'Book* book_shelf[10]' declares an array of 'Book' pointers. Now, you can assign the address of a 'new Text' or 'new Comic' object to these pointers. Slicing does not occur because the pointer stores the address of the actual derived object on the heap, and the full object remains intact. This also allows virtual functions to behave correctly. Of course, when using raw pointers with dynamic allocation, you must remember to manually deallocate the memory using 'delete'. Using smart pointers like 'std::unique_ptr' or 'std::shared_ptr' can automate this memory management, making your code safer.",

This results in the loss of any data members that are specific to the derived class, as each element in the array only has enough memory allocated for the base type. The consequences of slicing include incorrect program behavior, data loss, and issues with polymorphism, particularly if you try to operate on the sliced object itself. The definitive solution to avoid slicing is to always use arrays of base class pointers, or preferably smart pointers, when dealing with collections of polymorphic objects. This approach ensures that the complete derived objects are preserved in memory and that true polymorphic behavior, especially with virtual functions, is maintained.",

If a derived class, like 'Text' in our example, doesn't provide its own copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, or move assignment operator, the compiler will generate them by default. This default behavior has two main parts. First, for the base class portion of the object, the compiler's generated operation will call the corresponding operation from the base class. For instance, 'Text's default copy constructor will call 'Book's copy constructor. Second, for the data members that are unique to the derived class, like 'topic_' in 'Text', the compiler will perform a member-wise copy or move. So, when 'Text t2 = t1;' is executed, 'Book's copy constructor handles the 'Book' parts, and then 't1.topic_' is copied to 't2.topic_'.",

If your derived class manages resources that require deep copying, such as raw pointers, you'll need to implement custom copy operations. For a custom copy constructor in a derived class like 'Text', you must explicitly call the base class's copy constructor in the member initializer list. This ensures the base class part is copied correctly. After that, you handle the copying of the derived class's specific members, like 'topic_'. Similarly, for a custom copy assignment operator, it's good practice to first check for self-assignment. Then, you explicitly call the base class's copy assignment operator using 'Book::operator=(other);'. Following that, you copy the derived class's members. Finally, you return a reference to the current object, '*this'. The same principles apply to move constructors and move assignment operators, where you'd call the base class's move operations and use 'std::move' for the derived members.",

So, in the 'Text' move constructor, you'd call 'Book(std::move(other))' to invoke the 'Book' class's move constructor, and 'topic_(std::move(other.topic_))' to move the 'topic_'. A subtle point from the notes: even if the parameter to a copy constructor like 'const Text& other' happens to be bound to an rvalue (like a temporary object), within the function body, 'other' is an lvalue.

If 'operator=' were virtual, then the call '*pb1 = *pb2;' would dynamically dispatch to the 'operator=' of the actual type of '*pb1' (e.g., 'Text::operator='). However, making 'operator=' virtual is not straightforward. The signature of a virtual overridden function must match, so a virtual 'operator=' in 'Text' would typically take a 'const Book&' as its parameter. Inside this operator, you'd then need to use 'dynamic_cast' to safely check if the passed 'Book' reference is actually a 'Text' object before copying 'Text'-specific members. This adds complexity and runtime overhead. To summarize partial assignment: it's caused by using non-virtual assignment operators with base class pointers, leading to only the base part of an object being assigned. This can leave derived objects in an inconsistent state. While a virtual 'operator=' could theoretically address this, it requires careful implementation to handle type checking correctly.",

            "transcript": "Our final subtopic covers abstract superclasses and the implementation of virtual destructors. A strong design recommendation in C++ is that if a class is intended to be a base class in a polymorphic hierarchy (meaning you'll have pointers or references to it that might actually point to derived objects), then that base class should be abstract. An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated on its own; its purpose is to define a common interface or provide common functionality for its derived classes. You make a class abstract by declaring at least one of its member functions as pure virtual, for example, 'virtual void anOperation() = 0;'. This design forces users to instantiate only the concrete derived classes, which are expected to provide implementations for the pure virtual functions.",

However, there's a crucial rule specific to pure virtual destructors: even though it's declared pure, it must still be provided with an implementation. You need to define the body of 'AbstractBook::~AbstractBook()', even if that body is empty. This might seem counterintuitive for a pure virtual function, but it's essential for the destruction process in an inheritance hierarchy.",

            "transcript": "So, why must a pure virtual destructor be implemented? It's due to the way object destruction works in C++. When an object of a derived class is destroyed, a chain of destructor calls occurs. First, the destructor of the most derived class runs. After it completes, the destructor of its immediate base class is automatically invoked, and this process continues up the inheritance hierarchy until the destructor of the ultimate base class has run. This is known as destructor chaining. Even if the base class destructor is pure virtual, the derived class's destructor will still contain an implicit call to it. If you declare a pure virtual destructor but don't provide a definition (an implementation), the linker will be unable to find this function when it's trying to link the code for the derived class's destructor, resulting in a linker error. So, the definition is required to satisfy the linker during this chain-calling process.",

            "transcript": "Beyond the specific case of pure virtual destructors, it's critically important for any class intended as a base class in a polymorphic hierarchy to have a virtual destructor. Consider deleting a derived object through a base class pointer: 'Book* b_ptr = new Text(); delete b_ptr;'. If the destructor in the 'Book' class is not virtual, then only 'Book's destructor will be called. 'Text's destructor will be skipped, leading to potential resource leaks if 'Text' had acquired any resources that its destructor was supposed to release. However, if 'Book's destructor is virtual (whether it's pure virtual and implemented, or just regular virtual), then deleting through 'b_ptr' will correctly call 'Text's destructor first, followed by 'Book's destructor, ensuring proper cleanup of all resources. So, the rule of thumb is: if your class has any virtual functions, or if you intend for it to be a base class, make its destructor virtual.",

            "transcript": "In summary for our final subtopic: Using abstract superclasses is a highly recommended practice for designing polymorphic hierarchies. They help define clear interfaces and prevent the instantiation of base classes that are not meant to exist as standalone objects. A class becomes abstract if it contains at least one pure virtual function. A special case is the pure virtual destructor. While it makes the class abstract, it uniquely requires an implementation, even if that implementation is empty. This is to allow the destructor chain to complete successfully when derived objects are destroyed, thereby satisfying the linker. More broadly, any class intended to be a base class, especially if it has other virtual functions, should have a virtual destructor. This ensures that when a derived object is deleted through a base class pointer, the destructors of all classes in the hierarchy are called in the correct order, leading to proper resource cleanup and preventing memory leaks.",
