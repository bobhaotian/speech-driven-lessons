Binary trees are fundamental hierarchical data structures where each node can have, at most, two children: a left child and a right child. Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting, or processing, each node in a tree exactly once, following a specific order. Traversal algorithms are crucial for many tree operations, such as searching for a value, inserting new nodes, deleting existing nodes, or simply displaying the tree's contents. In this section, we'll focus on two primary traversal methods: Depth-First Search, or DFS, which explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking, and Breadth-First Search, or BFS, which explores all nodes at the current level before moving to deeper levels.",

If a node doesn't have a left or right child, the corresponding pointer will be a nullptr.

The `dfs` function takes a pointer to a TreeNode as input. The base case for the recursion is when the `root` pointer is `nullptr`, indicating we've reached the end of a branch or an empty subtree, so we simply return. Otherwise, we first print the data of the current node. Then, we make a recursive call to `dfs` for the left child, and after that returns, we make another recursive call for the right child.",

The `bfs` function also takes the root of the tree. If the root is `nullptr`, it returns. Otherwise, it creates a queue of TreeNode pointers and enqueues the root node. The main logic is a while loop that continues as long as the queue is not empty. In each iteration, it dequeues a node, let's call it 'current', processes its data (prints it, in this case), and then enqueues its left child (if it exists) followed by its right child (if it exists).

The BFS output for the same tree will be 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, and then 5, which is the level-order traversal.

            "transcript": "To summarize our discussion on binary tree traversals: We started by defining a TreeNode structure, which is fundamental for building binary trees. We then explored Depth-First Search, or DFS. DFS tends to go deep into the tree quickly. It's often implemented recursively, and variations like Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order depend on when the current node is processed relative to its children. Its space complexity is typically proportional to the height of the tree due to the recursion call stack. On the other hand, Breadth-First Search, or BFS, explores the tree level by level. It's usually implemented iteratively using a queue, and its space complexity is proportional to the maximum width of the tree. The choice between DFS and BFS depends heavily on the specific problem you're trying to solve. For example, DFS is often suitable for pathfinding in a maze or when you suspect solutions are located deep within the tree. BFS is excellent for finding the shortest path in terms of number of edges in unweighted graphs or trees, or when solutions are expected to be close to the root.",

Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm used to find a specific item within a sorted collection. Its core idea is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. This process continues until the value is found or the interval is empty. A critical prerequisite for binary search is that the input data must be sorted.

First, we initialize two pointers: 'left' to the beginning of the vector (index 0) and 'right' to the end of the vector (index size minus 1). The core of the algorithm is a loop that continues as long as the 'left' pointer is less than or equal to the 'right' pointer. Inside the loop, we calculate the 'mid' pointer. A common way to do this is `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`, which helps prevent potential integer overflow compared to `(left + right) / 2`. Next, we compare the target value with the element at the 'mid' index. If they are equal, we've found our target, and we return the index 'mid'. If the element at 'mid' is less than the target, it means the target, if it exists, must be in the right half of the current search interval. So, we update 'left' to be 'mid + 1'. Conversely, if the element at 'mid' is greater than the target, the target must be in the left half, so we update 'right' to be 'mid - 1'. If the loop completes without the target being found, it means the element is not present in the vector, and we typically return a value like -1 to indicate this.",
