We'll start by understanding default constructors, exploring their behavior, and identifying potential issues, especially when dealing with member objects that don't have their own default constructors. Then, we'll introduce Member Initialization Lists, or MILs, as the correct and efficient C++ mechanism for initializing class members, including special cases like const members and references. Finally, we'll cover destructors, explaining their role in resource cleanup and discussing when and how to write custom destructors, particularly in the context of the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization, or RAII, idiom, often seen with dynamically allocated memory like linked lists.",

This can be a constructor that explicitly takes no parameters, or one where all parameters have default values assigned. For instance, `MyClass()` is a default constructor, and so is `MyClass(int x = 0)`. If you don't define any constructors at all for your class, the C++ compiler will step in and generate a public default constructor for you.

Its constructor requires two integer arguments, `x_val` and `y_val`, and it doesn't provide default values for these. So, `Vec` has a user-defined constructor but no default constructor. Now, let's say we have another class, `Basis`, which contains two member objects of type `Vec`, named `v1` and `v2`. If we haven't defined any constructors in `Basis` ourselves, what do you think happens when we try to create an instance like `Basis b;`?",

The generated `Basis()` default constructor must, in turn, call default constructors for its members `v1` and `v2`.\n    3.  However, `Vec` has no default constructor (`Vec::Vec()` is not available because a user-defined `Vec::Vec(int, int)` exists).\n    4.  Therefore, the compiler **cannot** generate a default constructor for `Basis`.\n\n```cpp\n// In main.cpp\n#include \"basis.h\"\n\nint main() {\n  Basis b; // ERROR: no matching constructor for initialization of 'Basis'\n           // because Vec has no default constructor\n  return 0;\n}\n```",

Here's the chain of events: Since `Basis` has no constructors defined by us, the compiler attempts to generate a default one. This generated default constructor for `Basis` would then need to call the default constructors for its member objects, `v1` and `v2`. But here's the catch: our `Vec` class has a user-defined constructor `Vec(int, int)`. Once you provide any constructor, the compiler no longer generates a default one automatically for `Vec`. Since `Vec` has no default constructor, the compiler's attempt to create a default constructor for `Basis` fails. It simply doesn't know how to construct `v1` and `v2` without arguments.",

By the time the code inside the `Basis` constructor body executes, the member objects `v1` and `v2` would have already attempted their own default construction. Since `Vec` doesn't have a default constructor, this attempt would have failed even before our assignment. This approach still leads to a compilation error because the members `v1` and `v2` cannot be default constructed.

Trying to create an instance of the containing class using default construction, like `Basis b;`, will fail at compile time.

For our `Basis` class, the constructor definition would look like this: `Basis::Basis() : v1{1, 0}, v2{0, 1} {}`. This tells the compiler to initialize `v1` by calling `Vec(1,0)` and `v2` by calling `Vec(0,1)`. This initialization happens *before* the constructor body of `Basis` is executed.

A very important point is the order of initialization. Members are initialized in the order they are declared in the class definition, regardless of their order in the MIL. For example, if you declare `int b;` before `int a;` in your class, `b` will be initialized before `a`, even if your MIL lists `a{1}, b{2}`. To prevent confusion and potential bugs related to initialization order dependencies, it's a strong best practice to write the initializers in the MIL in the same order as the member declarations in the class.",

If a constructor's Member Initialization List explicitly initializes a member, the MIL takes precedence, and the in-class initializer for that member is ignored.

For `std::string`, this typically means its copy constructor (or move constructor, if applicable) is called with `student_name` as the argument. This is just one operation: direct construction.

The default destructor knows nothing about raw pointers and the memory they might own.

If this is the case, the default compiler-generated copy constructor and copy assignment operator are almost certainly going to be incorrect, usually performing shallow copies that can lead to problems like double frees or dangling pointers. The Rule of Three states that if you define any of these three (destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator), you should probably define all of them. C++11 introduced move semantics, extending this to the Rule of Five, adding the move constructor and move assignment operator.
