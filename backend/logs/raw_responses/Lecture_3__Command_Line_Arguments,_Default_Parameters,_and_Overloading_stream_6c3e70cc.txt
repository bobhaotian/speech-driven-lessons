So, `argv[1]` is the first argument, `argv[2]` is the second, and this continues up to `argv[argc-1]`. The standard also guarantees that `argv[argc]` will be a null pointer, which can sometimes be used as a sentinel value when iterating through the arguments. For example, if you execute your program as `./myprogram hello 123`, `argc` will be 3. `argv[0]` will point to the string \"./myprogram\", `argv[1]` to \"hello\", and `argv[2]` to \"123\".",

A safe and flexible way to do this is by using `std::istringstream` from the `<sstream>` header. You create an `istringstream` object from the argument string, and then you can use the extraction operator, `>>`, to parse the number, just like you would with `std::cin`.

For example, `./myprogram < input.txt` tells the operating system to feed the contents of `input.txt` to your program's standard input, which you would read using `std::cin`. In this case, `input.txt` is NOT a command-line argument; `argc` would just be 1 (for `./myprogram`), and `input.txt` would not appear in the `argv` array.

The notes on page 10 mention 'two command-line arguments' for this scenario, which typically refers to the arguments provided by the user after the program name, in this case '-n' and '20'.

You assign the default value using the assignment operator, like `std::string prefix = \"Info:\"`. A very important rule is that parameters with default values must be the trailing parameters in the function's parameter list. This means if a parameter has a default value, all parameters that come after it must also have default values. You cannot have a parameter with a default value followed by a parameter without one.

If we call `f(10)`, `x` is 10, and both `y` and `z` use their defaults, 3 and 4 respectively. If we call `f()` with no arguments, all parameters take their default values: `x=2, y=3, z=4`. The `printSuiteFile` example from page 10 also illustrates this. Calling `printSuiteFile()` uses the default \"suite.txt\", while `printSuiteFile(\"myfile.txt\")` overrides the default.",

      "transcript": "Default function parameters offer several benefits. They significantly reduce the complexity of function calls because users only need to provide values for parameters that deviate from the norm. This can lead to shorter, more readable function calls. They are also great for maintaining backward compatibility. If you need to add a new parameter to an existing function, you can give it a default value. This way, existing code that calls the function without the new parameter will still compile and run correctly, using the default. Common use cases include setting optional flags, providing default configuration settings like timeouts, or specifying default filenames or resource identifiers.",

Then, the program's execution flow transfers control to the starting point of the function's code. Crucially, memory needs to be set aside for the function to do its work; this includes space for its parameters and any local variables it declares. This memory is typically allocated on a region of memory called the call stack, within a data structure known as a stack frame. Once the setup is complete, the function's code executes. If the function returns a value, this value is prepared. Finally, the memory used by the stack frame is reclaimed (deallocated), and control returns to the point in the code where the function was originally called.",

This stack frame is a dedicated block of memory for that specific invocation of the function. It contains all the necessary information for the function to execute, such as the values of the parameters passed to it, space for its local variables, and, very importantly, the return address. The return address tells the program where to resume execution in the calling code once the current function completes. There might also be other bookkeeping information, like saved processor registers. When the function finishes and returns, its stack frame is removed, or popped, from the call stack. This last-in, first-out behavior makes the stack ideal for managing function calls, especially when functions call other functions (nested calls).",

As noted on page 11, if default parameters are involved, the caller is responsible for ensuring these values are correctly placed. Then, there's the return address, which is crucial for getting back to the caller. Often, there's also space for a saved frame pointer, which helps manage the chain of stack frames. Finally, space is allocated for the function's local variables.

      "transcript": "So, how do default parameters fit into this stack frame picture? Page 11 of the notes provides some key insights. First, if a programmer calls a function and omits arguments that have default values, the compiler steps in. At compile time, the compiler effectively rewrites that function call to explicitly include the default values. For example, if `printSuiteFile()` is called, and it has a default for its name parameter, the compiler might transform this call internally to be equivalent to `printSuiteFile(\"suite.txt\")`. Consequently, the caller—meaning the machine code generated for the place where the function is called—is responsible for placing all the argument values, including these defaults, into the stack frame (or into CPU registers, depending on the calling convention). The function itself, when it executes, simply assumes that all its expected parameters are present and correctly ordered at the beginning of its stack frame or in the agreed-upon registers.",

      "transcript": "To summarize the function call mechanism: function calls are managed using a call stack, where each active function call has its own stack frame. This frame stores parameters, local variables, and the return address. When default function parameters are used, the compiler handles them by modifying the function call at compile time to include the default values. The compiled code of the caller then ensures that all arguments, including these defaults, are properly placed for the called function to access. Therefore, at runtime, the function always operates with a complete set of arguments, regardless of whether some were supplied by defaults.",

      "transcript": "Next, we'll discuss function overloading, a powerful feature in C++. Function overloading allows you to define multiple functions that share the same name, provided they are in the same scope and have different parameter lists. This means the functions must differ in the number of parameters they take, or the types of their parameters, or both. This feature is useful because it lets you use one intuitive name for functions that perform conceptually similar tasks but operate on different kinds of data or with different sets of inputs. For example, you could have several `print` functions: one that prints an integer, another that prints a double, and a third that prints a string, all named `print`.",

A function's signature for overloading purposes in C++ primarily includes:\n1.  The function name.\n2.  The **number** of parameters.\n3.  The **type** of parameters (and their order).\n4.  `const`/`volatile` qualifiers on parameters, or on the function itself (for member functions).\n\n**Crucially, the return type alone is NOT enough to distinguish overloaded functions.**\n```cpp\n// Valid Overloads:\nvoid func(int x);\nvoid func(double x);\nvoid func(int x, int y);\n\n// Invalid Overload (differ only by return type):\n// int  calculate(int val);\n// double calculate(int val); // ERROR! Cannot overload based on return type only.\n```\n(As stated on page 12: \"# of Overloads must differ in # or type of args.\")",
      "transcript": "The key to function overloading lies in the function signature. For the compiler to treat functions as overloads, their signatures must be different. In C++, the signature components relevant for overloading are the function's name and its parameter list. The parameter list is distinguished by the number of parameters, the types of those parameters, and their sequence. `const` or `volatile` qualifiers on parameters, or on the member function itself if it's part of a class, also contribute to the signature. What's extremely important to remember is that the function's return type is NOT part of the signature for overloading purposes. You cannot have two functions that differ only in their return type and expect them to be valid overloads; this will result in a compilation error. As page 12 notes, overloads must differ in the number or type of their arguments.",

It examines the arguments you've provided in the function call and compares them against the parameter lists of all the functions with that name. The goal is to find the 'best match'. This matching process follows a hierarchy. The compiler first looks for an exact match, where the argument types perfectly align with an overload's parameter types. If no exact match is found, it considers standard type promotions, like converting a `char` to an `int`. If that doesn't yield a unique best match, it looks at other standard implicit conversions, such as `int` to `double`. User-defined conversions and functions with ellipsis arguments are considered later in the process. If the compiler cannot find any suitable function, or if the call is ambiguous because multiple functions match equally well and none is clearly better, it will generate a compile-time error.",

Similarly, when we call `neg(boolVal)` where `boolVal` is a boolean, the `bool neg(bool b)` version is selected. If we tried to call `neg` with an argument of a type for which no direct overload exists, like `neg(5.0)` (a double), the compiler would try to find a suitable conversion.

It's worth noting that in C++, structs are more powerful than in C. They can have member functions (methods), constructors, and destructors, much like classes. In fact, the primary difference between a `struct` and a `class` in C++ is the default visibility of their members: `struct` members are `public` by default, while `class` members are `private` by default.",
