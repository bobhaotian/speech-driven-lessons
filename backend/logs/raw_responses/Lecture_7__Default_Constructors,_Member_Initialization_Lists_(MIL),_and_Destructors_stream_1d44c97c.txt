This can happen in two ways: either the constructor has no parameters at all, or all of its parameters are specified with default values. For instance, in MyClass, the constructor MyClass() takes no parameters, making it a default constructor. In AnotherClass, the constructor takes two integer parameters, but both have default values (0), so it also qualifies as a default constructor. It's important to remember that if you don't declare any constructors for your class, the C++ compiler will automatically generate a public default constructor for you.

Now, suppose we have another class, Basis, which contains two member objects of type Vec, named v1 and v2.

The compiler attempts to generate a default constructor for `Basis` because we didn't provide one.\n2.  This compiler-generated `Basis()` default constructor needs to initialize its members `v1` and `v2`.\n3.  To do this, it tries to call the **default constructor for `Vec`** (i.e., `Vec()`).\n4.

The reason is that since we didn't provide any constructor for Basis, the compiler tries to generate a default constructor for it. This automatically generated default constructor for Basis must, in turn, initialize its member objects, v1 and v2. To initialize v1 and v2, it needs to call their default constructors, specifically Vec(). However, as we established, our Vec class does not have a default constructor. Because Vec lacks a default constructor, the compiler cannot successfully generate a default constructor for Basis. Therefore, the line `Basis b;` fails.",

The main issue arises when a class, let's call it class A, contains a member object of another class, say class B.

If it's a stack object, space is made on the current stack frame. If it's a heap object, memory is allocated using the `new` operator. Second, and this is crucial, the object's fields or members are constructed. This construction happens in the exact order that the members are declared within the class definition. If a member is itself an object of another class, its constructor is called at this point. Only after all members have been constructed does the third step occur: the constructor body itself runs.

If we try to create a constructor for Basis that initializes v1 and v2 inside its body like this: `v1 = Vec{1, 0}; v2 = Vec{0, 1};`, we run into a problem. Remember the object creation steps. Before the body of the Basis constructor executes (step 3), its members v1 and v2 must have already been constructed (step 2). Since we haven't specified how they should be constructed before the body, the system would attempt to call their default constructors. But Vec has no default constructor! So, this approach is fundamentally flawed because the assignment `v1 = Vec{1, 0};` is happening too late. It's an assignment to an already (attempted-to-be) constructed object, not an initialization.

In our Basis example, `Basis() : v1{1, 0}, v2{0, 1} {}` uses an MIL to initialize v1 and v2. This initialization occurs during step 2 of object creation, meaning v1 is directly constructed as `Vec{1,0}` and v2 as `Vec{0,1}`. There's no prior attempt to default-construct them, which resolves the issue we saw earlier. The constructor body can then be empty or used for other setup tasks.",

Members are always initialized in the order they are declared within the class definition, regardless of the order in which they appear in the MIL. For example, if a class MyClass declares member `b` before member `a`, then `b` will always be initialized before `a`, even if the MIL lists `a` first, like `MyClass(int val) : a{val}, b{a}`. In this specific snippet, `b` is declared before `a`, so `b` would be initialized first, potentially using an uninitialized `a` if `a` from the MIL was supposed to be used for `b`'s initialization. While the example shows `b{a}`, the `a` used here is the class member `a` which is initialized *after* `b`. This can lead to subtle bugs if one member's initialization depends on another. To prevent confusion and potential errors, it's a strong best practice to list members in the MIL in the same order as their declaration in the class.",

However, if a member *is* mentioned in the MIL, the MIL's initialization takes precedence and overrides the in-class initializer. In the first Config constructor, `verbose` is initialized via the MIL, while `path` and `retries` would use their in-class initializers. In the second Config constructor, all three members are initialized via the MIL, so their in-class initializers are ignored for that construction.",

Member Initialization Lists provide the correct mechanism, allowing initialization to occur during the field construction phase. Remember the syntax with the colon and comma-separated initializers.

If we initialize `name` in the constructor body by assigning `n_param` to `name`, two things happen. First, during step 2 of object creation, `name` is default-constructed, typically as an empty string. Then, in step 3, when the constructor body runs, the assignment operator of `std::string` is called to copy the contents of `n_param` into `name`. This is two operations: default construction and then assignment. In contrast, if we use an MIL like `name{n_param}`, the `name` member is directly constructed using `n_param` during step 2. This is just one operation – direct construction. This avoids an unnecessary default construction and subsequent assignment, making it more efficient, especially for complex objects.",

Consider a class `MyDynamicArray` that allocates an integer array using `new int[s]` and stores the pointer in `data`. If this class relies on the default destructor, the `data` pointer itself (which is a member) will be destroyed when `MyDynamicArray` object goes out of scope, but the actual array on the heap that `data` *points to* will not be deallocated.
