We'll start with inheritance, which allows us to create new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse and establishing 'is-a' relationships. Then, we'll delve into polymorphism, the ability for objects of different types to be treated through a common interface. The key C++ feature enabling this is virtual functions, which facilitate dynamic dispatch, meaning the correct function to call is decided at runtime. We'll cover how to control member access for derived classes using 'protected', understand potential pitfalls like slicing and static dispatch, and then see how virtual functions solve these. We'll also discuss the critical role of virtual destructors for correct memory management in inheritance hierarchies, and finally, touch upon 'final' classes and abstract classes defined by pure virtual methods.",

            "transcript": "Let's begin with the core idea of inheritance. Inheritance is a fundamental OOP principle where you can define a new class, called a derived class or child class, based on an existing class, known as a base class or parent class. This creates an 'is-a' relationship. For instance, if we have a general 'Book' class, we can derive a more specific 'Text' book class from it. A 'Text' book 'is a' type of 'Book'. This is powerful because it allows the derived class to inherit properties and behaviors from the base class, promoting code reuse. In our example, 'Book' is the base class with author, title, and length. 'Text' is derived from 'Book' and adds a specific 'topic' field. The 'public Book' part in the 'Text' class declaration signifies public inheritance, meaning public members of 'Book' remain public in 'Text', and protected members of 'Book' become protected in 'Text'.",

In our 'Book' and 'Text' example, the 'Text' class automatically has the 'author', 'title', and 'length' fields, as well as any public or protected methods defined in 'Book'.\n\nNow, let's talk about member accessibility. Public members of the base class are accessible everywhere. Protected members, which we'll discuss soon, are accessible within the base class and its derived classes. Crucially, private members of the base class are *only* accessible by the base class itself. This means that even though 'Text' inherits from 'Book', 'Text's methods cannot directly access 'Book's private fields like 'author', 'title', or 'length' if they were declared private in 'Book'. This encapsulation is a key principle of OOP, ensuring that the internal state of the base class is managed by its own methods.",

When you create an object of a derived class, say 'Text t', the process isn't as simple as just running the 'Text' constructor. First, the base class part of the object must be constructed.

After the 'Book' part is fully constructed, the 'Text' class's own data members are initialized – in our case, the 'topic' field. Finally, the body of the 'Text' class's constructor is executed.

This part explicitly tells the compiler to call the 'Book' constructor that takes an author, title, and length. This call happens *before* the 'Text' constructor body executes. After the base class constructor call, we initialize the 'Text' class's own members, like 'topic_'.\n\nIt's important to note: if you don't explicitly call a base class constructor in the MIL, the compiler will try to call the base class's default constructor (one that takes no arguments). If the base class doesn't have a default constructor, and you haven't explicitly called another one, your code won't compile.

This presents a dilemma: how can we allow derived classes some privileged access without making everything public?\n\nThe `protected` access specifier provides a solution. Members declared as `protected` in a base class can be accessed by methods of the base class itself and by methods of any class derived from it. However, unlike public members, protected members are not accessible by unrelated, external code. This offers a middle ground between the strictness of private and the openness of public.",

For example, the 'Book' class might assume that 'length_' is always a positive number. If a method in the 'Text' class directly modifies 'length_' and sets it to a negative value, it breaks this invariant, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in 'Book's methods.\n\nFurthermore, direct access to protected data members increases the coupling between the base and derived classes.

So, those parts are simply lost, or 'sliced off.'\n\nConsider our 'Comic' class, which inherits from 'Book' and adds a 'hero_' field. If you have a 'Comic' object 'myComic' and then write 'Book bookCopy = myComic;', 'bookCopy' will get the 'author', 'title', and 'length' from 'myComic'.

In this scenario, the compiler decides which version of the method to call based on the declared type of the pointer or reference, not on the actual type of the object it points to at runtime. This decision is made at compile time, hence 'static' dispatch or early binding.\n\nImagine both 'Book' and 'Comic' have an 'isHeavy' method, but with different logic. Say, a book is heavy if it's over 200 pages, but a comic is heavy if it's under 30 pages (just for example). If 'isHeavy' is not declared virtual in 'Book', and you have a 'Book' pointer 'bookPtr' pointing to a 'Comic' object, calling 'bookPtr->isHeavy()' will execute 'Book::isHeavy()'. Even though 'bookPtr' is pointing to a 'Comic', the compiler only sees 'bookPtr' as a 'Book*', so it calls the 'Book' version. This means 'myComic.isHeavy()' might give one result (using 'Comic's logic), while 'bookPtr->isHeavy()' gives a different result (using 'Book's logic), which is often not what we want for polymorphic behavior.",

            "transcript": "In summary of this subtopic: Slicing is the loss of derived-specific parts when a derived object is copied into a base class object. This happens because the base object only has space for base class members. Static dispatch, also known as early binding, is the mechanism used for non-virtual methods. When you call a non-virtual method through a base class pointer or reference, the compiler decides at compile time which version of the method to execute, based solely on the declared type of that pointer or reference, not the actual dynamic type of the object it might be pointing to. Both slicing and static dispatch for non-virtual methods limit our ability to achieve true runtime polymorphism, where the behavior adapts to the specific type of the object at runtime. The solution to enable this dynamic behavior lies in virtual functions, which we'll explore next.",

This rule holds true even if the base class destructor itself has no specific cleanup tasks to perform (i.e., its body is empty). The act of making it virtual ensures that the C++ runtime will correctly call the derived class's destructor first, followed by the base's, when `delete` is used on a base class pointer.

            "transcript": "Let's conclude Lecture 14. We've covered several foundational concepts in object-oriented programming with C++. Inheritance allows us to build new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse and modeling 'is-a' relationships. We saw the importance of constructor chaining using the Member Initialization List for proper object setup and discussed how 'protected' access can be used to grant derived classes special privileges, ideally through accessor and mutator methods rather than direct data access. The core of polymorphism lies in virtual functions, which enable dynamic dispatch. This allows the system to decide at runtime which method to call based on an object's actual type, overcoming issues like slicing (when using pointers/references) and static dispatch that occur with non-virtual methods. We emphasized the critical need for virtual destructors in base classes to ensure correct memory deallocation when dealing with derived objects through base pointers. Finally, we looked at 'final' classes, which cannot be further inherited, and abstract classes, defined by pure virtual methods, which serve as interfaces and cannot be instantiated directly. Mastering these concepts is key to writing robust, flexible, and maintainable C++ code.",
