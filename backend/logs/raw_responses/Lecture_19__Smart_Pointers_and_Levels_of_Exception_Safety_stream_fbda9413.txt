            "transcript": "Welcome to Lecture 19! Today, we'll delve into two critical aspects of modern C++ programming: smart pointers and exception safety. Smart pointers provide powerful mechanisms for managing memory and other resources, helping us avoid common pitfalls like memory leaks and dangling pointers. We'll explore the concept of pointer ownership and look closely at std::unique_ptr for exclusive ownership and std::shared_ptr for scenarios where multiple parts of your code need to share access to a resource. Then, we'll shift our focus to exception safety. This isn't just about catching exceptions; it's about designing functions that leave your program in a consistent and valid state, even when errors occur. We'll define different levels of guarantees that functions can offer, which is crucial for building robust and reliable software.",

            "transcript": "Let's start with the fundamental concept of pointer ownership. In C++, when you dynamically allocate memory or acquire a system resource, someone needs to be responsible for releasing it when it's no longer needed. Ownership clearly defines this responsibility. Ambiguous or incorrect ownership management is a common source of bugs, such as memory leaks (where memory is allocated but never freed), double deletes (attempting to free the same memory multiple times), and dangling pointers (using a pointer that refers to memory already freed). Modern C++ offers smart pointers to make ownership explicit and manageable, largely automating this cleanup process.",

            "transcript": "The std::unique_ptr is the primary smart pointer for expressing exclusive ownership. When you create a std::unique_ptr, you're saying that this smart pointer, and only this smart pointer, owns the object it points to. The most significant advantage is automatic resource management. When a std::unique_ptr goes out of scope – for example, at the end of a block or when a class instance containing it is destroyed – its destructor is called, which in turn automatically deletes the managed object. This mechanism, known as RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), greatly simplifies memory management and helps prevent leaks. As shown in the example, the MyClass object is automatically deleted when ptr goes out of scope. Furthermore, unique_ptr is designed to be very efficient, with performance characteristics close to that of a raw pointer.",

It can use the object pointed to, but it should not be responsible for deleting it. The actual owner, which could be a std::unique_ptr, a std::shared_ptr, or some other lifetime management mechanism, will handle the cleanup. For instance, the function 'observe_object' can use 'obj_ptr' but must not call delete on it. While this convention is common, it relies on programmer discipline and clear documentation.

It should be your default choice for managing dynamically allocated resources. Raw pointers, on the other hand, conventionally signify non-ownership. They are used to observe or borrow resources whose lifetimes are managed by an owner, such as a smart pointer or another system.

Conversely, when a shared_ptr instance is destroyed (goes out of scope) or is made to point to a different object or nullptr, the reference count is decremented.

            "transcript": "In summary, std::shared_ptr is the C++ smart pointer designed for scenarios requiring shared ownership of a resource. It employs a reference counting mechanism to track how many shared_ptr instances co-own the object, and the object is deallocated only when this count drops to zero. The preferred way to create a shared_ptr is using std::make_shared. Copying a shared_ptr increases the reference count, indicating another co-owner. While powerful, it does come with more overhead than unique_ptr, so it should be used when its specific shared ownership capabilities are needed, not as a default replacement for unique_ptr. Properly using shared_ptr is vital for preventing memory leaks in complex systems with shared resources. Always choose the smart pointer that best reflects the ownership model you intend for your resources.",

It's important to clarify that it doesn't mean your code never throws exceptions, as that's often impractical. It also doesn't mean you simply catch every possible exception, as that can mask underlying problems. Exception safety is about ensuring that if an exception does occur and is eventually handled somewhere up the call stack, your program remains in a valid, stable, and predictable state. This means, critically, that no resources are leaked (like memory or file handles), data structures are not left in a corrupted or inconsistent state, and all class invariants (the fundamental rules that define a class's valid state) are still upheld.",

If a function provides the basic guarantee, it means that if an exception occurs during its execution, the program will remain in some valid state.

It also ensures that no data structures are left corrupted, and all class invariants are preserved. The program can safely continue execution. However, the 'unspecified state' part is important: while objects are valid, their exact state after the exception might not be the same as before the function call, nor necessarily in a state that reflects partial completion.

This is often referred to as commit-or-rollback semantics.

For example, a simple swap of integers, or the destructor of a well-behaved class, should ideally be noexcept.

If a.g() modifies the state of 'a' or other program state, and then b.h() subsequently throws an exception, for C::f to provide the strong guarantee, it must somehow undo all the effects of a.g().

In this pattern, the class's actual data members are hidden inside a separate struct or class (the implementation), and the main class holds a pointer, often a std::unique_ptr, to an instance of this implementation. To perform an operation that needs strong safety, you first create a new temporary instance of the implementation, usually by making a deep copy of the current implementation. Then, you perform all potentially throwing operations on this temporary implementation instance. If any step throws, the original implementation pointed to by pImpl is untouched. If all operations succeed on the temporary copy, you then atomically swap the main class's pImpl pointer with the pointer to the temporary implementation. Swapping unique_ptrs is a no-throw operation. This effectively commits the changes. The old implementation is then typically destroyed when the temporary unique_ptr (which now points to the old state) goes out of scope.",

If any of these underlying components do not offer at least the basic guarantee – for instance, if A::g could leak resources or leave A in a corrupted state upon throwing an exception – then it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, for C::f to provide any strong, or even basic, guarantee.
